% Since this a solution template for a generic talk, very little can
% be said about how it should be structured. However, the talk length
% of between 15min and 45min and the theme suggest that you stick to
% the following rules:  

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

\subsection[Motivation]{Why prooritize defaults?}

\begin{frame}{Make Titles Informative. Use Uppercase Letters.}{Subtitles are optional.}
  % - A title should summarize the slide in an understandable fashion
  %   for anyone how does not follow everything on the slide itself.

Defaults with different conclusions\\
e.g. legal reasoning, Reasoning with experts Knowledge

%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item
%    Use \texttt{itemize} a lot.
%  \item
%    Use very short sentences or short phrases.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection[Approaches]{Two possible views}

\begin{frame}{Two possible views}
\begin{itemize}
  \item develop "default" language, special syntax
  \item use logic programming syntax 
     augmented by the preference relation
\end{itemize}

%  You can create overlays\dots
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item using the \texttt{pause} command:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item
%      First item.
%      \pause
%    \item    
%      Second item.
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item
%    using overlay specifications:
%    \begin{itemize}
%    \item<3->
%      First item.
%    \item<4->
%      Second item.
%    \end{itemize}
%  \item
%    using the general \texttt{uncover} command:
%    \begin{itemize}
%      \uncover<5->{\item
%        First item.}
%      \uncover<6->{\item
%        Second item.}

\subsection[Approach]{This Paper Approach}

\begin{frame}{This Paper Approach}
\begin{itemize}
  \item a's are normally b's
  \item dynamic priorities
  \item give semantics without new general purpose nonmonotonic formalism
  \item elaboration tolerant (small changes in intuition - small changes in program)
  \item some inference mechanism already available
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Logic Program P composed of}
\begin{itemize}
  \item logic program P composed of:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item domain independent axioms 
      \item domain description L
      \item notion of entailment between query and domain description

\subsection{Axioms of P}

\begin{frame}{Entailment in domain description}
  \textbf{Definition 2.2} We say that a domain description $\mathcal{D}$ entails
  a~query q $(\mathcal{D} \models q)$ if q belongs to every answer set
  of the~program \\
  $\mathcal{P}_\sigma(\mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{P}_\sigma \cup \{ holds(l) \ | \ l \in fact(\mathcal{D}) \} \cup laws(\mathcal{D})$. 

  $laws(\mathcal{D})$ denotes set of statements of the form \ref{item:rule1} and \ref{item:rule2}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Axiomy}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Examples}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item go through programming students example, show it running on computer
    \item example of flying penguin, ask them and let them quess,
       then show the correct answer on pc
    \item maybe use example 3.3 (not yet ready)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Extending the language}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $default(d,l_0,[l_1, l_2, ... l_m], [l_m+1, ... l_n])$
    \item show new axioms
    \item example 4.1 : who can vote?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Weak Exceptions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item "do not apply default d to objects satisfiyng property p" 
    \item How to do it?
    \item $exception(d, [l_1, ... ,l_n] [l_n+1,...ln+m])$
    \item add new axiom: defeated(D) :- exception ......    
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Cautions reasoning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Two contrary defaults - no result will be done
